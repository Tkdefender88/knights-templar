      <p>Philip is the raddest youth pastor this side of the millennium. Known for making everyone crack up about the 
      mysterious "diet water" in the church water jug, his humor is legendary. Occasionally he takes on the challenge of 
      sneaking a suggested joke word into his sermons—one week it was "baby hippopotamus." And of course, youth group 
      never truly starts until he bellows at the top of his lungs: <strong>"LEEEEAAAADEERRRRR MEEEEETTTINNNNGGG!!"</strong>
      Favorite quote? You guessed it: <strong>"Love you, mean it"</strong>.</p>
      <p>He once baptized five kids in a slip-n-slide. Legend.(this may or may not be true, but we can dream)</p>
